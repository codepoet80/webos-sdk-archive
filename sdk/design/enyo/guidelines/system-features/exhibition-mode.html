      A New Mode for Presenting Your Content
    </h2>
    <p>
      Exhibition mode is launched automatically when the device is placed on the HP Touchstone Charging Dock, or it can be launched manually from the App Launcher. Apps can be written to run in Exhibition mode, either as an extension to your existing app, or as stand-alone Exhibition mode apps, allowing you to create all-new app experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user can switch between different apps in this mode using the App menu. A few Exhibition mode apps are built-in, such as a Clock app, but our hope is that it will be you, our developers, who create truly great experiences for this mode.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The full range of system functionality and UI components are available to apps in Exhibition mode. You have free reign to create as you would in any other view in your app. You can also use Exhibition mode to cross-link to your regular app and exit Exhibition mode.

    <h2 id="designing-for-exhibition-mode">
      Designing for Exhibition Mode
    </h2>Focus on creating experiences that are suitable for this mode. Users are likely to be interacting with the device only occasionally and while concentrating on other activities--therefore, design your Exhibition mode app to require minimal input and to automatically refresh itself with content. Keep content visual and easy-to-scan so that it can attract users' attention, even though they may be focused on other things or may not be close to the device.<br>
