      Buttons: Push Buttons

      What They Are
    </h2>
    <p>
      Push buttons are used to enable the user to perform an action. They are called push buttons because the user needs to tap or &quot;push&quot; them to trigger the action. The button takes on a &quot;Pressed&quot; state when pressed, and returns to its normal state when the finger is lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Push buttons can also have a &quot;Disabled&quot; state, which is shown when the button's action cannot be completed. The &quot;Disabled&quot; state is also shown when an activity indicator is shown in the button--see the section on <a href="/design/enyo/guidelines/designing-your-app/providing-feedback.html">Providing Feedback</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a variety of different standard colors for buttons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Light grey</strong> is the default color for buttons and should be used in most circumstances.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Grey</strong> is used to indicate a primary action out of a selection of different choices. The primary action is the action that would generally be selected in most cases. If there is no primary action, then do not use the dark grey color.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Green</strong> is used in situations where the user needs to make a decision between a positive and a negative action--e.g., between &quot;Done&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;, or &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;. The green button should be used to indicate the positive choice. In task flow navigation (see <a href="/design/enyo/guidelines/navigation-patterns/task-flow-navigation.html">Task Flow Navigation</a> section), the &quot;Done&quot; button should be green.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Red</strong> is used to indicate an action that has destructive consequences. It is typically used for a delete action.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Blue</strong> is used to highlight a button to draw the user's attention to it. Use blue if you want to make an action prominent in the interface. The blue color should be used sparingly.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      When To Use
    </h2>Use push buttons to enable the user to trigger actions--push buttons are commonly used in interactive pop-ups and dialogs, within lists, and in headers and footers.<br>
